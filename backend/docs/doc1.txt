Deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms that use multi-layer neural networks to learn representation and mapping from inputs to outputs. Over the last decade, deep learning has become the dominant approach for many tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, and more. The essential idea is to stack layers—linear transforms followed by nonlinear activations—such that the network can learn hierarchical features: lower layers capture local or simple patterns, while deeper layers capture higher-level semantics.

At the core of deep learning are several building blocks. First, the basic neuron computes a weighted sum followed by an activation function such as ReLU, tanh, or sigmoid. Second, architectures differ by how layers are connected: feedforward networks (MLPs) connect layers sequentially; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) apply shared-weight convolutions for processing grid-like data such as images; recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their gated variants (LSTM, GRU) are sequence models designed to capture temporal dependencies; transformers use attention mechanisms to model relationships between any pair of positions in a sequence and have become the dominant architecture in language modeling and many sequence tasks.

Training deep networks relies on gradient-based optimization (e.g., stochastic gradient descent and its variants like Adam). Backpropagation computes gradients efficiently using the chain rule. Optimization challenges include vanishing/exploding gradients, which are mitigated by careful initialization, normalization techniques such as batch normalization, and architectural choices. Regularization strategies such as dropout, weight decay, and data augmentation reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Model capacity must be balanced with dataset size: very large models can memorize small datasets, while too-small models may underfit.

Important practical considerations include learning rate schedules (step decay, cosine annealing, warm-up), batch sizes, and data pipeline performance. Transfer learning—pretraining a model on a large dataset and fine-tuning on a downstream task—has become a standard practice because it significantly reduces training time and improves results for tasks with limited labeled data.

Evaluation uses task-specific metrics: accuracy, precision/recall/F1 for classification, BLEU/ROUGE for generation, IoU for segmentation, and so on. Interpretability and robustness are active research areas: practitioners examine saliency maps, gradient-based attribution, and adversarial examples to understand models' failure modes. Efficient training and inference strategies—such as quantization, pruning, distillation, and sparse attention—enable deployment of large models in constrained environments.

Overall, deep learning is distinguished by its emphasis on learned hierarchical representations, scalable optimization, and empirical success across diverse domains. Continued research focuses on improving data efficiency, safety, interpretability, and reducing the environmental and compute cost of large models.

Smart farming applies sensors, connectivity, analytics, and automation to optimize agricultural productivity, resource efficiency, and sustainability. Key objectives include precision irrigation, soil health monitoring, pest detection, crop yield prediction, and supply-chain traceability. Sensors widely used in agriculture include soil moisture probes, temperature/humidity sensors, NDVI-capable multispectral cameras on drones, acoustic sensors for pest detection, and weather stations. These sensors provide high-resolution spatiotemporal data that enable targeted interventions rather than uniform treatments across fields.

Precision irrigation uses soil moisture and evapotranspiration models to supply water where and when crops need it. Actuation systems (valves, pumps) respond to control logic executed at the edge or in the cloud. Machine learning models predict water stress, pest outbreaks, or nutrient deficiencies using time-series data and satellite imagery. Drones and satellite imagery provide macro-level views; ground sensors provide high-frequency local validation.

Designing a farm-monitoring IoT system requires attention to power management (solar panels, energy harvesting), robust wireless connectivity (LoRaWAN for wide-area low-power links, or NB-IoT for cellular coverage), and data handling. Local decision-making at the edge reduces latency and preserves connectivity costs.

Data pipelines aggregate, clean, and transform sensor data for analytics. Algorithms range from simple heuristics (threshold alerts) to complex predictive models (yield forecasting using historical weather and soil data). Traceability uses immutable records and can involve blockchain for provenance, particularly for export-grade produce where origin and handling history must be auditable.

Socioeconomic considerations are important: smallholder farmers need low-cost, low-maintenance solutions and clear value propositions. User interfaces should be localized and accessible via mobile phones. Farmer training and extension services are essential for technology adoption. Environmental sustainability is a major benefit: precision agriculture lowers water and chemical usage while improving yields.

Smart farming combines hardware reliability, connectivity, domain models, human-centered design, and economics to deliver practical solutions that can be piloted at small scales and later scaled up for regional impact.

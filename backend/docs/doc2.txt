The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to networks of physical devices—sensors, actuators, appliances, and machines—connected to the internet to monitor, collect, and exchange data. A well-designed IoT architecture typically follows a layered model: device (sensors/actuators), edge (gateways and local processing), fog (regional processing and aggregation), and cloud (centralized storage, analytics, and management). Each layer plays a role: devices gather raw telemetry; edge nodes preprocess data to reduce transmission cost and latency; fog nodes provide regional compute and storage; the cloud performs heavy analytics, model training, and long-term storage.

Sensors capture environmental signals—temperature, humidity, soil moisture, vibration, sound, and images. Actuators perform actions—opening valves, switching relays, adjusting motors. Edge gateways handle device protocols (MQTT, CoAP, BLE, LoRaWAN), provide secure connectivity, and often run local analytics or filtering to reduce bandwidth usage. Key edge functions include sensor fusion, data compression, local anomaly detection, and runtime constraints handling.

Fog computing introduces intermediate compute resources closer to the devices than the cloud. Fog resources can run orchestration services, regional machine learning inference, and rapid decision logic that requires lower latency than cloud-only solutions. The cloud offers elastic storage, cross-site data correlation, model training on large datasets, and management APIs for device provisioning and lifecycle.

Security and privacy are critical. Devices must use secure boot, device attestation, and encrypted communication. Identity and access management ensures only authorized devices and users interact with the system. Privacy-preserving techniques—encryption-at-rest, differential privacy, and federated learning—reduce exposure of sensitive data. Reliability requires monitoring, over-the-air updates, and fallback mechanisms.

Data flows can be streaming (telemetry pipelines with Kafka, MQTT brokers) or batch-oriented. Time-series databases like InfluxDB and Prometheus are common for telemetry, while object stores hold unstructured sensor payloads like images. For constrained networks, protocols like LoRaWAN or Sigfox provide low-power wide-area connectivity, while Wi-Fi, cellular, and Ethernet provide high-throughput options.

Design decisions hinge on application constraints: latency tolerance, connectivity reliability, energy availability, cost, and regulatory requirements. Smart-city or industrial IoT systems emphasize robustness and deterministic behavior; consumer IoT prioritizes user experience and frictionless setup. Overall, successful IoT systems blend hardware design, embedded software, networking, data engineering, and cloud services into cohesive solutions.
